Smart Contracts: BEEM161 - Basic Smart Contract Analysis

Welcome to the exercise on Basic Smart Contract Analysis. In this session, we will be exploring the fundamental concepts and tools used for analyzing smart contracts written in Solidity.

As the use of blockchain technology continues to gain momentum, smart contracts have emerged as a critical component of blockchain-based applications. However, smart contracts can be vulnerable to various security risks, which can result in financial losses or other negative consequences. Therefore, it is essential to understand how to analyze smart contracts to identify potential issues and ensure that they function as intended.

In this exercise, we will use a combination of tools, including VSCode, Solidity Visual Developer, Ganache, RemixIDE, and Metamask, to analyze smart contracts. Additionally, we will introduce optional tools such as TruffleCLI, TruffleSuite, and Slither for advanced analysis.

By the end of this exercise, you will have a solid understanding of the basics of smart contract analysis and the tools available to identify and mitigate potential risks. So let's dive in and explore the exciting world of smart contract analysis.
