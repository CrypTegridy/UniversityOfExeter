Smart Contracts: BEEM161 - Basic Smart Contract Analysis

Welcome to today's exercise on Basic Smart Contract Analysis. In this session, we will be discussing the tools and techniques used to analyze and understand Solidity smart contracts. Specifically, we will be using VSCode, Solidity Visual Developer, RemixIDE, and Metamask, with the optional tool, Slither.

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain, and they have become increasingly popular due to their ability to automate complex processes and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries. However, like any other software, smart contracts can have bugs or vulnerabilities that can lead to unintended consequences, such as loss of funds or theft.

Therefore, it is important to have a good understanding of how to analyze and evaluate smart contracts to ensure they are secure and function as intended. In this lecture, we will explore the various tools and techniques used in smart contract analysis, and demonstrate how they can be used to identify potential issues and improve the overall security and functionality of the contracts.

So, let's get started by discussing the tools we will be using, including VSCode, Solidity Visual Developer, RemixIDE, Metamask, and Slither, and how they can be used in smart contract analysis.

To follow along with the exercise you will need tohe following:

1.	We will be using VSCode, Solidity Visual Developer, RemixIDE, Metamask | *Optional* Slither.

2.	Open VSCode and Install any needed tools to follow along.
